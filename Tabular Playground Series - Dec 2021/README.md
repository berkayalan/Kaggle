Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. 
In the past, they've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.

In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, they're trying a new experiment in 2021. 
They'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.
